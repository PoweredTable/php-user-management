Leave `XAMPP` up and running after its installation.

## Database
The database needs to be manually set up for this project.
- Access `phpMyAdmin` through the `XAMPP` control panel and select the SQL tab.

- Copy the contents of the `ddl.sql` file located in the root of this project and paste it into the query box, then click on `Execute`.

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set your own values for the variables if required.

## Installation
Download the project by visiting the [releases page](https://github.com/PoweredTable/php-user-management/releases) of this repository and unzip the file, or you could also simply clone it.

To work with `XAMPP`, ensure the project is located in the `XAMPP` installation folder, e.g. `C:\xampp\htdocs`.

Inside the project folder, install the required dependencies using `Composer`.
